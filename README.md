# hivestats
A command line interface that monitors CPU usage data for instructional accounts in the EECS department at UC Berkeley.

Hivestats is a tool that helps Berkeley students SSH into an instructional account that will offer them the best performance.
You can monitor CPU usage [on Allan Guo's site](http://aguo.us/hivemind/) and pick a low-use machine on your own, but with the hivestats CLI (command-line utility), that is done for you. A simple command, `hivestats login` gets you to the best-available EECS instructional account.
